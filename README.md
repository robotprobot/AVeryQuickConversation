# AVeryQuickConversation
AVeryQuickConversation is a simple text chat server and client written in Python.

### What ACTUALLY is AVeryQuickConversation?
AVeryQuickConversation is a server and client that allows users to send text messages to the server and read messages from the server. 
Messages are NOT encrypted and are not saved. It is a very simple chatroom system.

### Why the name "AVeryQuickConversation"?
The name was chosen to reflect the fact that this software was made quickly, is not at all secure and does not save any conversation information.

### Okay, so why did you make this?
I made this to refresh my knowledge on Python. It was just a fun little project.
